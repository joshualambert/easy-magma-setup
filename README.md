# Magma Orchestrator + NMS Installer (Ubuntu 22.04 / K3s)

This repository provides a robust script for deploying **Magma Orchestrator** and **NMS (Network Management System)** on a single-node Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server using K3s (lightweight Kubernetes). The installation uses self-signed certificates and is designed for simplicity and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Features

The installation script:

1. Generates and saves secure credentials at the beginning of installation
2. Installs and configures K3s Kubernetes and Helm
3. Clones the Magma repository and installs required components
4. Sets up databases (PostgreSQL for Orchestrator, MySQL for NMS)
5. Deploys Magma Orchestrator and NMS web interface
6. Creates an admin user for immediate access
7. Provides clear progress indicators at each step
8. Saves all credentials to a secure file for future reference

---

## üì± Accessing Your Installation

After successful installation, you'll receive:
- URL to access the NMS interface
- Admin credentials for login
- Database passwords and access information

All credentials are saved to `magma-credentials.txt` in your home directory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. Use the built-in troubleshooting tool:
```bash
./install_magma.sh troubleshoot
```

2. Check pod status:
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

3. View logs for specific pods:
```bash
kubectl logs -n orc8r POD_NAME
```

4. For database issues:
```bash
kubectl logs -n db $(kubectl get pods -n db -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

5. If you need to start over:
```bash
./install_magma.sh cleanup
```

## üìù Notes & Limitations

- The installation uses self-signed certificates by default
- For a production environment, consider implementing proper TLS certificates
- The default configuration uses a NodePort service type - configure proper ingress for production use
- Database SSL is disabled by default for easier setup - enable it for production deployments
